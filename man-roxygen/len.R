#' @param len Length of the generated vectors. If `len` is a
#'   single number all vectors will have this length. If
#'   `len` is a numeric vector of length 2 it will produce
#'   vectors with lengths between a minimum and maximum,
#'   inclusive. For example `len = c(1L, 10L)` would produce
#'   vectors with lengths between 1 and 10. To produce empty vectors
#'   set `len = 0L` or a range like `len = c(0L, 10L)`.
