This is a re-submission.

I have added documentation for return values of `for_all` and `show_example`.
I have removed an example for `for_all` because the examples took over 5 seconds.

## Test Environments

- local R installation, R 4.1.0
- Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC
- Windows Server 2022, R-devel, 64 bit
