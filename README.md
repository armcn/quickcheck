# Overview

Property based testing in R, inspired by
[QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck). This package
builds on the property based testing framework provided by
[`hedgehog`](https://github.com/hedgehogqa/r-hedgehog) and is designed
to seamlessly integrate with a [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org).

## Installation

You can install the released version of quickcheck from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("quickcheck")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("armcn/quickcheck")
```

# Usage

The following example uses quickcheck to test the properties of the base
R `+` function.
[Here](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing/)
is an introduction to the concept of property based testing, and an
explanation of the mathematical properties of addition can be found
[here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/cc-6th-factors-and-multiples/properties-of-numbers/a/properties-of-addition).

``` r
library(testthat)
library(quickcheck)

test_that("0 is the additive identity of +", {
  for_all(
    a = numeric_(len = 1),
    property = \(a) expect_equal(a, a + 0)
  )          
})

test_that("+ is commutative", {
  for_all(
    a = numeric_(len = 1),
    b = numeric_(len = 1),
    property = \(a, b) expect_equal(a + b, b + a)
  )          
})

test_that("+ is associative", {
  for_all(
    a = numeric_(len = 1),
    b = numeric_(len = 1),
    c = numeric_(len = 1),
    property = \(a, b, c) expect_equal(a + (b + c), (a + b) + c)
  )          
})
```

Here we test the properties of the
[`distinct`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/distinct.html)
function from the [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html)
package.

``` r
library(dplyr)

test_that("distinct does nothing with a single row", {
  for_all(
    a = any_tibble(rows = 1L),
    property = \(a) {
      distinct(a) |> expect_equal(a)
    }
  )
})

test_that("distinct returns single row if rows are repeated", {
  for_all(
    a = any_tibble(rows = 1L),
    property = \(a) {
      bind_rows(a, a) |> distinct() |> expect_equal(a)
    }
  )
})

test_that("distinct does nothing if rows are unique", {
  for_all(
    a = tibble_of(integer_positive(), rows = 1L, cols = 1L),
    b = tibble_of(integer_negative(), rows = 1L, cols = 1L),
    property = \(a, b) {
      unique_rows <- bind_rows(a, b)
      distinct(unique_rows) |> expect_equal(unique_rows)
    }
  )
})
```

## Hedgehog generators

quickcheck is meant to work with hedgehog, not replace it. hedgehog
generators can be used simply by wrapping them in `from_hedgehog`. Under
the hood all this function does is wrap the hedgehog generator in an
anonymous function and add the `quickcheck_generator` class to it.

``` r
library(hedgehog)

is_even <- 
  \(a) a %% 2 == 0

gen_powers_of_two <- 
  gen.element(1:10) |> gen.with(\(a) 2 ^ a)

for_all(
  a = from_hedgehog(gen_powers_of_two),
  property = \(a) is_even(a) |> expect_true()
)
```

Any hedgehog generator can be used with quickcheck but they canâ€™t be
composed together to build another generator. For example this will
work:

``` r
for_all(
  a = from_hedgehog(gen_powers_of_two),
  b = integer_(),
  property = \(a, b) c(a, b) |> is.numeric() |> expect_true()
)
```

But this will cause an error:

``` r
for_all(
  a = tibble_of(from_hedgehog(gen_powers_of_two)),
  property = \(a) is_tibble(a) |> expect_true()
)
```
