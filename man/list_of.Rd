\title{Variable length list generator}
\usage{
list_of(generator, len = c(1L, 10L))
}
\arguments{
\item{generator}{A \code{quickcheck_generator} object.}

\item{len}{Length of the generated vectors. If \code{len} is a
single number all vectors will have this length. If
\code{len} is a numeric vector of length 2 it will produce
vectors with lengths between a minimum and maximum,
inclusive. For example \code{len = c(1L, 10L)} would produce
vectors with lengths between 1 and 10. To produce empty vectors
set \code{len = 0L} or a range like \code{len = c(0L, 10L)}.}
}
\value{
A \code{quickcheck_generator} object.
