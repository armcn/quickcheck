\title{Atomic vector generator}
\usage{
any_atomic(len = 1L, frac_na = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{len}{Length of the generated vectors. If \code{len} is a
single number all vectors will have this length. If
\code{len} is a numeric vector of length 2 it will produce
vectors with lengths between a minimum and maximum,
inclusive. For example \code{len = c(1L, 10L)} would produce
vectors with lengths between 1 and 10.}

\item{frac_na}{The approximate fraction of \code{NA} values to
be included in the vector. A fraction of 0, the default,
will include no \code{NA} values. A fraction of 0.5 would
include around 50\% \code{NA} values.}
}
\value{
A \code{hedgehog.internal.gen} generator
}

or factors.
